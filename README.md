Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple Java console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:
   - You'll be prompted to guess a number within a given range.
   - You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
   - After each attempt, you'll receive feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
   - The game continues until you guess the correct number or use up all your attempts.
5. You can choose to play multiple rounds if you want.
6. Once you finish playing, your average attempts per round will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the variables at the beginning of the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file. For example:
- `minRange` and `maxRange` define the range of the randomly generated number.
- `maxAttempts` sets the maximum number of attempts allowed per round.
